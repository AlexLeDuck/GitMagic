Once upon a time


A boy and his dog were walking through the park when they encountered a cat.


The cat started at him



It started to walk towards the dog


The dog began to bark at the cat.




A dog realized that he is a dog.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


At this moment, a bird flying over.



She is looking at the dog.


The dog ate too many donuts and threw up.

Following the bird was a hawk.




The dog wiped it's eyes.



It wasn't actually a bird, it was superman.



The end.

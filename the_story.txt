Once upon a time


The cat started at him


and the abyss stared back.



It started to walk towards the dog




A dog realized that he is a dog.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


and realized he was the cat all along.


At this moment, a bird flying over.



She is looking at the dog.



The end.

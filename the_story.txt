Once upon a time


A boy and his dog were walking through the park when they encountered a cat.


The cat started at him


and the abyss stared back.



It started to walk towards the dog


The dog began to bark at the cat.


The cat continued strolling towards the dog confidently.


A dog realized that he is a dog.


He began to question everything he knew, like the cat was playing some kind of mind game.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


and realized he was the cat all along.


At this moment, a bird flying over.



She is looking at the dog.


The dog ate too many donuts and threw up.

Following the bird was a hawk.




The dog wiped it's eyes.



It wasn't actually a bird, it was superman.



The end.

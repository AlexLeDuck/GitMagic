Once upon a time


The cat started at him



It started to walk towards the dog




A dog realized that he is a dog.


He recalled the cat he saw in a dark corner.


At this moment, a bird flying over.



She is looking at the dog.


The dog ate too many donuts and threw up.

Following the bird was a hawk.


The end.
